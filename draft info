* Factors. Factors could include demographic or phenotypic groups, environmental conditions, technical attributes, or others listed in Section 4.3.
   * – Relevant factors
   * – Evaluation factors
* Metrics. Metrics should be chosen to reflect potential realworld impacts of the model.
   * Model performance measures
   * Decision thresholds
   * Variation approaches
* Evaluation Data. Details on the dataset(s) used for the quantitative analyses in the card.
